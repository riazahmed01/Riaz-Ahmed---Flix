### Notes
The coding part isn't really that difficult as I am able to follow along the video walk through for the most part. The hardest part of this assignment for me was resizing the posters so it fit into the cell correctly in the superhero tab. I was careless and did not change estimated size to none in my collection view and I spent a lot of hours trying to figure out why my posters arent showing properly. I even re-did my code multiple times before I finally found what the issue was.

### Notes
I didn't have too many difficulties with this. I missspelled "AlamofireImage" as "AlamoFireImage" and that took me a minute to fix.
